## About Me
<div class="myWrapper" markdown="1">


I born and raised in Thessaloniki, Greece but I live abroad since 2006. Spending some years in UK and Germany, I now live with my family in Woking, Surrey, a nice village outside London.

I was trained as a computer scientist but as I always had a passion about biology and wanted to see if we can cure cancer, I moved to the field of bioinformatics. I have more than 15 years of experience in analyzing high throughput mutlti-omic and healthcare data and transforming complex data into actionable insights and innovative solutions.


### Professional Highlights

- **Leadership and Innovation:** Founded DIGNOSIS Ltd, where I spearhead the development of advanced bioinformatics pipelines using AI/ML methodologies. My work includes significant collaborations with industry leaders such as UCB, Mission Bio, and King’s College London, focusing on patient stratification, drug discovery, and repurposing.
  
- **Product Development:** As a Product Owner at Congenica Ltd, I led cross-functional teams of engineers and bioinformaticians to develop and launch a CE-Marked IVD clinical decision support platform for oncology. My strategic vision and product management skills have successfully reduced time-to-market and improved product roadmaps.

- **Academic and Industry Expertise:** Extensive background in bioinformatics and clinical applications, with a PhD from King’s College London. My academic work is complemented by professional roles that include key positions at Bering Limited and Thermo Fisher Scientific, where I developed strategies and infrastructures for next-generation sequencing and clinical decision-making tools.

### Core Competencies

- **Technical Proficiency:** Expert in Python, R, TensorFlow, and big data ecosystems like Hadoop and Spark. Proficient in developing and evaluating machine learning models, particularly in the context of genomics and medical records.

- **Strategic Problem-Solving:** Known for my analytical and problem-solving skills, I am adept at identifying challenges, making data-driven decisions, and leading projects from inception to completion under pressure.

- **Communication and Collaboration:** Strong communicator with a proven ability to manage large teams, foster long-term partnerships, and drive customer satisfaction through effective product integrations and support.

I am driven by a commitment to excellence and a desire to contribute to the next generation of healthcare innovations.
